Scripts to make my life easier 


**Clean my X Folder **
Purpose: I have files of every type everywhere in every major folder: Documents, Pictures, Videos, Downloads, Desktop. 
This code is to help first uniformly figure out what is each of those folders and put them in their appropriate buckets in each of those locations 

Modify the file target, and take all of the files in a folder [ignores current folders], and 
  1) Reads all the extensions for 'files' that are in the folder currently
  2) Create a folder for each extension type that is represented in the folder that does not exist already
  3) Places files of each extension into their respective folder


Next step: 
Have this script run through multiple folders, then report what extension folders are in each of the 'major areas'. From there, merge folders into the correct locations for them. 

E.g., move all video folders into video, and merge them into a centralized extension folder in those 'major areas' 

Create unique folders [3D Models, Arduino Code, Python Code, etc.] under C\Users\<me>, and organize those files appropriately
